# Code examples of strings in Zig

I am using this repository to document and to store some practical examples that demonstrates concepts about strings in Zig. In other words, in the Zig programming language, strings are treated in a special manner, and because of that, a person comming from a different language might have some trouble in:

- understanding how exactly strings work in Zig;
- understanding how to do a specific string operation in Zig;
- understanding how strings in Zig differentiate from strings in other languages;

This repository seeks to document some of these concepts to help me learning this language. And I hope these examples might also help you too ðŸ˜‰.
